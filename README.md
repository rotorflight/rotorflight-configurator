# Rotorflight Configurator

**Rotorflight** is a _Flight Control_/_FBL_ Software Suite for traditional single-rotor RC helicopters. It is based on Betaflight 4.2, enjoying all the great features of the Betaflight platform, plus many new features added for helicopters. Rotorflight borrows ideas and code also from Heliflight3D, an earlier fork of Betaflight for helicopters.

**Rotorflight Configurator** is a cross-platform configuration tool for the Rotorflight flight control system. It is available for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

Rotorflight does **NOT** support multi-rotor 'drones', nor airplanes; it is only for traditinal RC helicopters, including co-axial and tandem helicopters.


## Installation

Please download the latest version from github:

 - https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight-configurator/releases

Then follow the instructions on the [Website](https://www.rotorflight.org/docs/Tutorial-Setup/Flashing-the-firmware).

## Notes

#### MacOS X users

Changes to the security model used in the latest versions of MacOS X 10.14 (Mojave) and 10.15 (Catalina) mean that the operating system will show an error message ('"Rotorflight Configurator.app" is damaged and canâ€™t be opened. You should move it to the Trash.') when trying to install the application. To work around this, run the following command in a terminal after installing: `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Rotorflight\ Configurator.app`.

#### Linux users

In most Linux distributions your user won't have access to serial interfaces by default. To add this access right type the following command in a terminal, log out your user and log in again:

```
sudo usermod -aG dialout ${USER}
```

#### Graphics Issues

If you experience graphics display problems or smudged/dithered fonts display issues in Rotorflight Configurator, try invoking the `rotorflight-configurator` executable file with the `--disable-gpu` command line switch. This will switch off hardware graphics acceleration. Likewise, setting your graphics card antialiasing option to OFF (e.g. FXAA parameter on NVidia graphics cards) might be a remedy as well.
